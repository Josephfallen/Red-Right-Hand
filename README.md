# UIU Rescue Squad

A plugin that adds a new class to your server named "UIU Rescue Squad". Their job is helpping the NTF completing their task. They have a chance to spawn instead of a squad of NTF.

# Installation

**[EXILED](https://github.com/Exiled-Team/EXILED) must be installed for this to work.**

**CustomRoles need to be enabled on your server for this to work.**

Place the `UIURescueSquad.dll` file in your EXILED/Plugins folder.

# Features

* Class has a configrable percent chance to spawn instead of NTF
* A configurable spawn location
* Commands to spawn individual members and a squad manually (individual members needs the give custom role permission, and a squad needs the RoundEvents permission)
* Announcements for a squad of UIU spawning, as well for ntf spawning to let the players know which one spawned
* Compatible with [RespawnTimer](https://github.com/Michal78900/RespawnTimer)!
